Global Outlook::Digital Humanities (GO::DH) is a Special Interest Group (SIG) of the [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations](http://digitalhumanities.org/) (ADHO). The purpose of GO::DH is to help break down [barriers that hinder communication and collaboration](http://dpod.kakelbont.ca/2012/11/02/in-a-rich-mans-world-global-dh/) among researchers and students of the Digital Arts, Humanities, and Cultural Heritage sectors in high, mid, and low income economies. GO::DH is not an aid or an outreach programme. Participants come from all over the world, and we all recognize that excellent work is being done around the world; furthermore, we know that students, researchers, and institutions in all geographic regions and types of economies all have much to contribute to the development of digitally enabled work in the arts, humanities, and cultural heritage sector. What GO::DH does instead is leverage the complementary strengths, interests, abilities and experiences of participants through special projects and events, profile and publicity activity, and by encouraging collaboration among individual projects, institutions, and researchers. Its core activities are **Community-Building**, **Research**, and **Advocacy**. It helps its members learn more about digital work in the Arts, Humanities, and Cultural Heritage sectors; it acts to foster collaboration and cooperation across regions and economies; it coordinates research on and in support of the use of technology in these areas across the globe; and it advocates for a global perspective on work in this sector. By sharing expertise, resources, experiences, and problems, we all become better practitioners of our common discipline.
