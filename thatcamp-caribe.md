The THATCampCaribe series brings the unconference model to the Caribbean region, and is part of our efforts to deepen our collaboration with its scholars and practitioners. THATCamp Caribe 1 took place at the University of Puerto Rico in Mayag√ºez in 2012. To learn more about that event you can visit the [website for the unconference](http://caribbean2012.thatcamp.org/). THATCamp Caribe 2 took place in Casa de las Americas in Havana, Cuba in 2013. To learn more you can visit the [website for this unconference here](http://caribbean2013.thatcamp.org/). We are now in the early stages of planning our third iteration for 2015 as a collaboration with Create Caribbean, Inc. in Dominica. Stay tuned for more!
