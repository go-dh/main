[The Translation Toolkit](http://go-dh.github.io/translation-toolkit/about/) is first and foremost our attempt at drawing attention to the need to acknowledge the linguistic diversity that already exists in the field of DH.

Similarly, it is the imperfect result of the lessons learned during our previous ad hoc practices at the INKE Meeting in Havana in 2013 and in DH2014 in Laussane. We are constant language learners.

It is also a catalogue of ready available tools and suggested best practices (where best is synonymous to it has worked for someone) to approach the sometimes daunting task of translating and preparing multilingual resources whether at conferences, in editorial and authorial journal work, and website and resource developments. The selection follows the principle that there is no right or single approach to translation and multilingualism, and embraces the principle that each one might work at a particular time and circumstance.

Finally, the Toolkit is an invitation to anyone who has ever put into practice any given translation or multilingual approach to share it with everyone here.

Ultimately, the Translation Toolkit proposes that the labor of translation in DH cannot be delegated to a group, and especially not the linguistic minorities. Instead, it embraces and seeks to put into practice that translation should be a labor shared by the whole community.
