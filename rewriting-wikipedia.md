The Rewriting Wikipedia Project is a working group within GO:DH that works in conjunction with Postcolonial Digital Humanities (#dhpoco) to increase the number of and improve existing entries on marginalized peoples and cultures. The Rewriting Wikipedia Project argues that editing Wikipedia is one of the most important projects for global activists because Wikipedia is a commonly referenced source of information riddled with incomplete or missing entries on people from marginalized groups. Yet, anyone can edit Wikipedia, so this openness represents tremendous opportunity to help shape global forms of knowledge.
